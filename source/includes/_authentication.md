# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: some-api-key"
```

> Make sure to replace `some-api-key` with your API key.

Codewars uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Codewars API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Codewars expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: f9b92bd1-12fa-420d-b743-e9f188a5ca68`

You must replace `some-api-key` with your personal API key.
